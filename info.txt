Scope should have the connections:

Ch1: HD
Ch2: AOM

What is done upon start:

1. Connect to devices
StateGenerator
2. Find AOM's amplification gain
	- Send 1V and -1V from Pitaya and check output on scope after amplifier
3. Find highest voltage of AOM which doesn't saturate Pitaya scope
	- Send different voltages to AOM, scan HD and measure until a value which doesn't saturate the scope is obtained
3. Find lowest transmission on EOM
	- Send 100 different voltages to EOM BIAS, scan HD to measure amplitudes and choose the smallest one
